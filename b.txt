for  more  reliable  and  accurate  fingerprint  recognition  systems, various   machine   learning   techniques   are  used  to   fingerprint recognition. Machine learning techniques providenontraditional solutions  in  which  algorithms constructa  featuresvectorfrom inputand train  the computer to  process  thesevectorsaccording to a specificlearningrule.  Some  novel pioneermachine  learning algorithms  are  Support  Vector  Machine  (SVM),  Deep  learning algorithms  (DL),  Artificial  Neural  Network  (ANN),  and  Genetic Algorithm(GA)   can   be   excellent   candidates   for   solving   the challenges of fingerprint recognition problems[38].This  significantinputof  this  paperis  to providean  overview  of certainmachine    learningtechniques used in    fingerprint recognitionsystems.   This   study   can   also   be   used   as   the foundation    for    creating    the    new    machine    learning    based algorithms  to  identify  fingerprints.  In  this  study, we  only  take into  account  the  most  promising  machine  learning  techniquesand  their  implementation  during  certain stagesof  fingerprint recognition systems.This paper contains three sections namely section 2 summarizes components    fingerprint    recognition    system    starting    from fingerprint acquisition to fingerprint classification and matching. Fingerprint  structure  and  fingerprint  features  also  explained  at beginning  of  section  2.  Section  3  explained  a  precise  review  on various   machine   learning   techniques   developed   by   various researchers   in   fingerprint   recognition   area.   There   are   many Machine Learning techniques available in fingerprint recognition field  but  because  of  precise  review  paper  some  of  them  like Artificial   Neural   Network,   SupportVector   Machine,Genetic Algorithms,  and  Deep  learning  based  techniques  are  discussed here. Finally, Section 4 explained the conclusion and future work in this direction

Fingerprint recognitionThis   section   shows   how   a   fingerprint   recognition   system   is implemented   to   comprehend   the   use   of   machine   learning methods   in   every   phase.   Let   us   start   our   discussion   from fingerprint structure.Fingerprint StructureFingerprints  are  graphic  crests  present  on  human  fingers  and unique  to  each  person.It  is  defined  as  a  harmonic  pattern  of interleavedridges  and  valleyson  the  fingertip.However, major fingerprint  valleysand  ridgesare adjacenton fingertip  area  but also suffered  from some  deformation like  scars,  cuts,  cracks and calluses[5].  Analyzing  the  pattern  of  ridges  and  valleys  on  the fingerprint   reveals   different   types   of   features   which   can   be represented by three levels: (i) Level 1(Global Patterns) (ii) Level2  (Minutiae  points  or Local Patterns)  (iii)  Level  3  (Low  level Patterns)[6,38].  Figure  2  shows  the  examples  of  fingerprint features revealed from ridges and valleys patterns.The Level  1  features  considered  the  entirefingerprintimage  to represent  features  so  called  global pattern,  and for  the  entire fingerprint  image,  a  single  representation  is  valid.  An  important feature  of  global structureis  the special  pattern  of  ridge  and valleys,   called   Singular   Point   (SP)or   singularitiesand   the importantsingularpoints  are  the  core  and the delta  (See  in Figure  2(b)).  The  core  is  defined  as  the top most  point  on  the innermost ridges and a deltaisdefined as the center point where three  different  directions  flows  meet.  The  Singular Points  (SP)provides   important   information   for   coarse   enrolment   and classification[8].  Level  2  features  considered  local  interesting regions  of  ridges  and  valleys  for  features  extraction,  hence  also called  local pattern.  Level  2  represents  features  called  minutiae. Minutiae  are  the  abrupt  endings  of  the  ridges,  For  example,  a ridge canfinish abruptly (ridgetermination), or canbesplitinto two ridges (ridge bifurcation) (Figure 2(c))[7]. Minutiae are the highest   discriminate   features   so   widely   used   in   fingerprint recognition systems. Level 3 considers a very low level (i.e. small details  found  on  fingerprint)  hence  called  low  structure;  local structure   includes   sweat   pores,   scars,   and   breaks.   Level   3 features  are  usedless  frequently  because  these  are  difficult  to capture by the simple sensors and high cost[6].

Fingerprint recognitionThis   section   shows   how   a   fingerprint   recognition   system   is implemented   to   comprehend   the   use   of   machine   learning methods   in   every   phase.   Let   us   start   our   discussion   from fingerprint structure.Fingerprint StructureFingerprints  are  graphic  crests  present  on  human  fingers  and unique  to  each  person.It  is  defined  as  a  harmonic  pattern  of interleavedridges  and  valleyson  the  fingertip.However, major fingerprint  valleysand  ridgesare adjacenton fingertip  area  but also suffered  from some  deformation like  scars,  cuts,  cracks and calluses[5].  Analyzing  the  pattern  of  ridges  and  valleys  on  the fingerprint   reveals   different   types   of   features   which   can   be represented by three levels: (i) Level 1(Global Patterns) (ii) Level2  (Minutiae  points  or Local Patterns)  (iii)  Level  3  (Low  level Patterns)[6,38].  Figure  2  shows  the  examples  of  fingerprint features revealed from ridges and valleys patterns.The Level  1  features  considered  the  entirefingerprintimage  to represent  features  so  called  global pattern,  and for  the  entire fingerprint  image,  a  single  representation  is  valid.  An  important feature  of  global structureis  the special  pattern  of  ridge  and valleys,   called   Singular   Point   (SP)or   singularitiesand   the importantsingularpoints  are  the  core  and the delta  (See  in Figure  2(b)).  The  core  is  defined  as  the top most  point  on  the innermost ridges and a deltaisdefined as the center point where three  different  directions  flows  meet.  The  Singular Points  (SP)provides   important   information   for   coarse   enrolment   and classification[8].  Level  2  features  considered  local  interesting regions  of  ridges  and  valleys  for  features  extraction,  hence  also called  local pattern.  Level  2  represents  features  called  minutiae. Minutiae  are  the  abrupt  endings  of  the  ridges,  For  example,  a ridge canfinish abruptly (ridgetermination), or canbesplitinto two ridges (ridge bifurcation) (Figure 2(c))[7]. Minutiae are the highest   discriminate   features   so   widely   used   in   fingerprint recognition systems. Level 3 considers a very low level (i.e. small details  found  on  fingerprint)  hence  called  low  structure;  local structure   includes   sweat   pores,   scars,   and   breaks.   Level   3 features  are  usedless  frequently  because  these  are  difficult  to capture by the simple sensors and high cost[6].
